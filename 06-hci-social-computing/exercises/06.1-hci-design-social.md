# Exercise 06.1 - HCI Design and Social Computing
## CS4320/7320 Software Engineering

### Individual Assignment: HCI Design
In this exercise, you will use the results from your module five architecture and design assignment to design two user interface artifacts. 
1. The first will be an information flow design through the website for submitting the assignment. This is, essentially, a menu structure, with an indication of which page leads to the next page. 
2. You will design 3 screens related to the architecture and design your team produced. Each of these screens should be website sized. You are not designing for mobile devices. The drawings should be clearly related to the information design, and represent one full set of actions. For example, submitting an assignment. **These are not high fidelity web prototypes. The Ideal approach is a pencil sketch of the screens at first**

### Individual Assignment: HCI Evaluation
1. You need to learn if the design you came up with for your one full set of actions is one that can be followed by an "ordinary user". To that end, follow this process with 2 different test subjects not in this course. These are the preparation steps:  
 - Explain the task you have chosen for them, such as submitting an assignment. 
 - Time how long this exercise takes with each user
 - Ask the user to "think aloud" about what they are looking at, how they are interpreting your work, and why they are making the choices they are making. 
2. Perform Evaluation
 - Show them the first screen you expect them to arrive at in the course of performing your chosen action. 
 - Ask your subject to perform the action, starting with this page. 
 - Write down what happens. If they are completely stuck at the first page, offer a hint to see if you can get them to the next step. 
 - When they make a choice, show them the screen for that choice, and proceed. If they are wrong, they can navigate backwards and try again. 
 - Ultimately, report whether or not each user is able to navigate through your user interface. 
3. Write up a summary of each of the users experience with your first design. 
4. Keep your first design for submission as part of this assignment

### Iterate your HCI Design
1. Based on what you learned from your evaluation, write a few sentences stating what changes you plan to make, and why (i.e., what happened in the study that made you think of that change.)
2. Create your new design for the pages, and, if you think necessary, the information flow design (menu system). 
3. Repeat the HCI Evaluation with one user. 

### Submission: 
1. Your first information flow
2. Your first screen designs
3. The results of your first evaluations for each user, including all the information requested above under "HCI Evaluation". 
4. Your revised page, and possibly information flow designs
5. The results of your second evaluation
6. A 1-3 paragraph reflection on what you learned about human computer interaction design through this process.
