# 05.2 - Discussion
Using the discussion thread in canvas, Relate your own experiences interacting with people through technology to each of the articles presented. I do not expect you to read every article in its entirety. Much can be garnered by reading the introductions and discussions alone. Also make at least four responses to your course mates posts. The five articles focus on: 
1. Github as "social coding"
2. Online dating as a social computing technology"
3. Social computing for individuals working together in isolated, but connected, rural workplaces
4. Predicting sporting game outcomes by monitoring tweets
5. Constructing a computational model of social computing 

Each article presents a different perspective. 
1. Identify a point in 2 different articles from the required readings that are related to your experience, or if you do not have any, one of the other articles.  
2. Post your point as the head of a new discussion thread for **each** article (five posts). 
3. Respond to four other people's points, being careful not to repeat yourself, and striving to engage in spirited, respectful discussion. Your answers do not have to be long, but thoughtful.
